# code-refractor
Code refracting is an important task for a web developer. Its the act of going through a functioning code and organizing it so that you and other developers can go back at a later date and understand why lines of code are there with minimal trouble.

The example we were given was a website for an online company. the website was fully funtional, but when looking at both the HTML and CSS, trying to understand the code became difficult. Some unclarities in the HTML code I found were: The p and li opening and closing tags along with their content were on three separate lines causing the code to be significantly longer than it should have been. Another thing I saw were there were too many div designations in CSS. Since the elements call for the same properties, I was able to consolidate some divs creating a clearer, shorter code. One final thing that I observed that made the CSS confusing was there were some ID tags that were not being used. I ended up deleting them to make the code more concise.
